# Maternal-Health-Risk-Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing maternal health risk factors through a comprehensive dataset that includes various health metrics. The goal is to identify trends, correlations, and distributions of health indicators across different age groups, helping healthcare professionals understand risk patterns and improve patient care.

The analysis includes visualizations such as pivot tables and charts, correlation matrices, and scatter plots to illustrate key findings related to blood pressure, blood sugar, heart rate, and body temperature. By leveraging these insights, we aim to inform targeted interventions for high-risk individuals and promote better maternal health outcomes.
